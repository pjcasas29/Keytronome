Metronome application to aid in playing in different keys

# Motivation

This application is for any musician who would like a customizable metronome that displays all 12 keys in different orders. 

The user can select:

- Tempo
- Time signature
- Number of cycles (times the metronome will go around the same set of keys)
- Order of keys currently supporting:
    - Chromatic
    - Fifths
    - Fourths
    - Thirds
    - Whole steps
    - Random order
- Starting key
- Measures per Key (Number of measures until the next key chaange occurs)
